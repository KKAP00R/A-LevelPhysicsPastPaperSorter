# Security Policy

Security is one which I as a developer never have or would ever choose to violate.
Security is given main focus in the creation of all code.

## Supported Versions

All versions until now are supported

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | SUPPORTED          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the case of a vulnerability send an Email to - karan-kapoor@outlook.com describing the vulnerability in detail.

Vulnerabilities reported will be taken into consideration and tested immediately, following testing if the vulnerability is true and serious, the version on which the vulnerability is detected will be deleted.
In the upcoming 2-3 weeks a new stable version will be uploaded
